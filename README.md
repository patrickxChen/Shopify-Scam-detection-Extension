# Guardify

Guardify is a Chrome extension that helps identify potentially fake or low-quality Shopify product listings. It scans a product page for common risk signals (like thin descriptions, repetitive copy, low image count, or suspicious pricing) and summarizes the results in a simple popup for quick review.

## What this project includes

- A React-based popup UI
- A content script that reads product page signals
- Basic heuristics to score listing risk

## Status

This is an early prototype focused on building the scan flow and UI. The detection logic will evolve as more signals are added.
